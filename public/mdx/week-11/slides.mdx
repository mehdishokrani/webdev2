# CPRG-306 Week 11

# API Implementation

---

## Topics

- TypeScript
- API Routes

---

## TypeScript

- superset of JavaScript
- statically typed language
- transpiled to JavaScript
- provides type checking
- provides interfaces and generics

---

## API Routes

- RESTful API
- HTTP methods
  - GET
  - POST
  - PUT
  - PATCH
  - DELETE
- API routes
  - `/api/...`

---

## API Implementation

- In Next.js API routes are implemented using `route.js` files in any folder, usually in an `api` folder
- e.g. `/api/users/123` will be implemented in `/app/api/users/[id]/route.js`
- CRUD operations can be implemented using API routes
- e.g. DELETE `/api/users/123` will delete user with id `123`
- e.g. GET `/api/users` will return all users

---

## Coding Demo

- Construct a simple API
- Test the API
- Consume the API
