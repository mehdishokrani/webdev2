# Week 8 Assignment

## Overview

This week's assignment continues to build upon the Shopping List application we developed in Week 7. We will add authentication to our application using Firebase Authentication and GitHub OAuth.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this assignment, you should have completed the Week 7 Assignment and have a working shopping list application. If you have not completed the Week 7 assignment, you have three options:

1. Use another student's Week 7 Assignment as a starting point for this week's assignment. Refer to the list of [student repositories](/student-work/github-accounts).

2. Use your assignment solution from Week 3 as a starting point for this week's assignment. Refer to the [Week 3 Assignment](/week-3/assignment) for instructions.

3. Start from scratch. To practice authentication, you really just need a simple application that has a login page and a protected page.

## Part 1: Create a Firebase Project

Follow this step-by-step guide to create a Firebase project with GitHub OAuth web app.

## Part 2: Add Firebase Authentication

<Steps>

### Install Firebase

In your project folder, install the Firebase SDK using npm.

```bash
npm install firebase
npm install encoding
```

### Setup Files

Let's first create a new folder for this assignment and populating it with the files from previous assignments to use as a starting point. The main shopping list application is going to reside in `week-8/shopping-list`. `week-8` will be the landing page with login functionality. We are also going to add more structure to our application by creating a a `utils` folder to hold our Firebase code.

- Create a new folder called `week-8` inside your `app` folder.
- Create a new folder called `shopping-list` inside your `week-8` folder.
- Copy `page.js`, all components, and the `json` file from `week-7` to `week-8/shopping-list`.

We will add a `page.js` file to the `week-8` folder later.

### Create Firebase Config

- Create a new folder called `_utils` inside your `week-8` folder.
- Create a file called `firebase.js` inside your `week-8/_utils` folder.

Use the following code for the contents of `firebase.js`.

```js copy
// Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
// TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
// https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID,
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
```

### Create `.env.local` File

- Create a new file called `.env.local` in your project root folder. This is in the same folder as your `package.json` file.
- Add the following environment variables to your `.env.local` file. Replace the values with your Firebase project values from the Firebase console. (Last step of Part 1.)

```bash copy
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=""
```

</Steps>

## Part 3: Create AuthContext and useAuth Hook

In the `_utils` folder, create a file called `auth-context.js` and add the following code.

```js copy
"use client";

import { useContext, createContext, useState, useEffect } from "react";
import {
  signInWithPopup,
  signOut,
  onAuthStateChanged,
  GithubAuthProvider,
} from "firebase/auth";
import { auth } from "./firebase";

const AuthContext = createContext();

export const AuthContextProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  const gitHubSignIn = () => {
    const provider = new GithubAuthProvider();
    return signInWithPopup(auth, provider);
  };

  const firebaseSignOut = () => {
    return signOut(auth);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribe = onAuthStateChanged(auth, (currentUser) => {
      setUser(currentUser);
    });
    return () => unsubscribe();
  }, [user]);

  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, gitHubSignIn, firebaseSignOut }}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
};

export const useUserAuth = () => {
  return useContext(AuthContext);
};
```

## Part 4: Add AuthContextProvider to `layout.js`

In the `week-8` folder, create a file called `layout.js` and add the following code.

```js copy
import { AuthContextProvider } from "./_utils/auth-context";

const Layout = ({ children }) => {
  return <AuthContextProvider>{children}</AuthContextProvider>;
};

export default Layout;
```

## Part 5: Add a Landing Page with Login Button

In the `week-8` folder, create a `page.js` file. This will be the landing page for our application. Display a login button if the user is not logged in. If the user is logged in, display a welcome message, a logout button, and a link to the shopping list page.

The following code snippets may be helpful. _This is not a complete component!_

```js copy
// Import the useUserAuth hook
import { useUserAuth } from "./_utils/auth-context";

// Use the useUserAuth hook to get the user object and the login and logout functions
const { user, gitHubSignIn, firebaseSignOut } = useUserAuth();

// Sign in to Firebase with GitHub authentication
await gitHubSignIn();

// Sign out of Firebase
await firebaseSignOut();

// Display some of the user's information
<p>
  Welcome, {user.displayName} ({user.email})
</p>;
```

- `user` is the user object returned from Firebase Authentication. If the user is not logged in, the value will be `null`.
- `gitHubSignIn` is a function that will open a popup window to allow the user to sign in with GitHub.
- `logOut` is a function that will log the user out.

## Part 6: Protect the Shopping List Page

Even though a user can't see a link to the shopping list page without being logged in, we should still protect the page so that if a user tries to access the page directly, they won't be able to see the shopping list.

In the `week-8/shopping-list/page.js` file, check if the user is logged in by using the `useUserAuth` hook and if the `user` object is null, do not render the shopping list page. Optional: You can redirect the user to the landing page if you want.

## Part 7: Deploy to Vercel (Optional)

If you wish to deploy your application to Vercel, you will need to make the following changes.

<Steps>

### Add environment variables to your Vercel project

On the Vercel website, go to your project and click on the Settings tab. Click on Environment Variables. Do one of the following:

- Copy your environment variables from your `.env.local` file and paste them into the Vercel environment variables.
- Upload your `.env.local` file.
- Add your environment variables manually one-by-one.

### GitHub OAuth Homepage URL

In the GitHub OAuth settings, change the Homepage URL from `http://localhost:3000` to your Vercel URL. Click "Update application".

### Add Vercel URL to Firebase

In the Firebase console, go to your project settings. Click on "Authorized domains". Click the "Add Domain" button and add your Vercel URL.

</Steps>

## Extras

A few things you can do to improve your application:

- After logging in, redirect the user to the shopping list page.
- Add a logout button to the shopping list page.
- Add a profile page that displays the user's profile information.
- Add other OAuth providers such as Google.

## Example Output

https://cprg306-assignments.vercel.app/week-8

Also, try to go to the shopping list page directly without signing in [https://cprg306-assignments.vercel.app/week-8/shopping-list](https://cprg306-assignments.vercel.app/week-8/shopping-list)

## Assignment Submission
