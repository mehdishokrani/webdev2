## Authentication vs Authorization

- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of a user
- **Authorization**: Verifying what a user has access to
- **Firebase Auth**: Service that provides authentication for web, mobile, and desktop applications
- **OAuth**: Open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords

---

## React Context

- A way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level avoiding prop drilling
- A global state that can be accessed from any component (e.g. user info, language, theme)
- `createContext` is a function that creates a new context
- `Context.Provider` and `Context.Consumer` are the two main components to use
- `useContext` is a hook that allows you to use the context

---

## Custom Hooks

- A JavaScript function whose name starts with "use" and that may call other hooks
- A way to share logic between components
- A way to abstract complex logic into a single function
- e.g. `useUserAuth` to handle user authentication logic

---

## Environment Variables

- A way to store sensitive configuration settings for an application
- Not hard-coded in the source code
- Not stored in the version control system (e.g. Git)
- Stored in a `.env.local` file
- Must be copied to deployment environment
- e.g. API keys, database connection strings, passwords

## Coding Demo

- Following most of the steps from the assignment, implement a simple web application from scratch with authentication
