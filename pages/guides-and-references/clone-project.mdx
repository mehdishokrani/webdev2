# Guide: Cloning a Next.js Project Repository

## Clone Repository and Run Locally

You can use the following steps to clone and run any Next.js project repository from GitHub. In this part, you will clone a Community Event app. Each week, the course content references this app and you will be able to see the changes in the app as you progress through the course.

<Steps>

### Clone the course demo repository

Open GitHub Desktop and select "Clone a repository from the Internet...".

Choose the tab "URL" and enter the following repository URL: https://github.com/warsylewicz/webdev2-community-events

Choose a local path where you want to clone the repository to on your computer. It is recommended to NOT use a location that is synced with a cloud service such as OneDrive, Google Drive, or Dropbox.

Click "Clone".

### View and run the course demos

Open Visual Studio Code and select "File" > "Open Folder..." and select the folder where you cloned the course demo repository to.

For the question "Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?" selected "Yes, I trust the authors".

Open a terminal in VS Code by selecting "View" -> "Terminal" and type the following commands:

```PowerShell
npm install

npm run dev
```

You should see output that shows something like this:

```PowerShell
   â–² Next.js 14.0.1
   - Local:        http://localhost:3000
   - Environments: .env.local
```

Ctrl-click on the URL to open the application in your browser. You should see a page where you can click "Week 1".

To stop the application, press Ctrl-C in the terminal.

**Congratulations! You have successfully cloned and run the course demo repository.**

### Pulling latest changes

As the course progresses, I may update this the code in the GitHub repository. You can pull the latest changes from the course demo repository to get the latest content.

To do this, open the course demo repository in GitHub Desktop and click "Fetch origin" in the top right corner. Then, if available, click "Pull origin" to pull the latest changes.

If "Pull origin" does not appear, that means you already have the latest changes.
