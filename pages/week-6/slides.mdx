# Managing State

- Immutability
- Component Lifecycle
- Sharing State Between Components

---

## Immutability

- State should be treated as immutable
- Never mutate state directly
- Always use `setState` to update state

---

## Immutability Demo

Create a broken counter that increments by 1 that doesn't use `setState`

---

## Component Lifecycle

- Initial Render
- State Change
- Schedule Update
- Reconciliation
- Update State
- Re-render

---

## React State Batching Demo

Demo: Create a broken counter that uses `setState` multiple times

---

## Sharing State Between Components

- Lifting State Up

---

## Lifting State Up Demo

1. Create a Dog component, display name and age
2. Create a DogList component, display a list of Dogs
3. Create a DogForm component, allow user to add a new dog
4. Create a Page component that displays the DogList and DogForm
5. Consider adding a delete button to the Dog component
