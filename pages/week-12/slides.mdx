## Serverless Relational Databases

- hosted in the cloud and are managed by a cloud provider
- scalable and can be accessed from anywhere
- easy to set up and use
- cost-effective, as you only pay for what you use

## Connections

- Connection string
  - a string that contains the information required to connect to a database
- Connection pool
  - a cache of database connections maintained so that the connections can be reused when required
- Connection timeout
  - the maximum time that a connection can be idle before it is closed
- Cold start
  - the time it takes for a serverless database to start up when it is not being used
