## Tagged Template Literals

- allow you to parse and manipulate template strings with a custom function
- Commonly used for:
  - Creating domain-specific languages (DSLs)
  - Securely embedding expressions (e.g., SQL queries)
  - Localization and formatting

---

## Example

```javascript
// Define an asynchronous function to insert a new user
async function insertUser(email, name, age, role) {
  // Use the sql tagged template literal to construct the query
  const result = await sql`
    INSERT INTO users (email, name, age, role)
    VALUES (${email}, ${name}, ${age}, ${role});
  `;
  return result;
}
```

## Serverless Relational Databases

- hosted in the cloud and are managed by a cloud provider
- scalable and can be accessed from anywhere
- easy to set up and use
- cost-effective, as you only pay for what you use
- e.g. Neon, PlanetScale, FaunaDB, Supabase, Vercel Postgres

---

## Connections

- Connection string
  - a string that contains the information required to connect to a database
- Connection pool
  - a cache of database connections maintained so that the connections can be reused when required
- Connection timeout
  - the maximum time that a connection can be idle before it is closed
- Cold start
  - the time it takes for a serverless database to start up when it is not being used

---

## Coding Demo

- Create an API to perform CRUD operations on a serverless database
- Test the API
- Consume the API in a client application
